# Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️

Hi Anh Tan,

I made this because normal messages don’t feel enough.

Thank you for coming into my life.
Thank you for being patient with me.
Thank you for making me feel safe, loved, and understood.

With you, I can be myself.
With you, I don’t feel alone.
With you, I feel home.

I don’t know what the future will look like,
but I know I want you to be part of it.

Happy Valentine’s Day.

— Rexy ❤️
