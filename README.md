Hi Anh Tan,

I made this because normal messages don’t feel enough.

Thank you for coming into my life.
Thank you for being patient with me.
Thank you for making me feel safe, loved, and understood.

With you, I can be myself.
With you, I don’t feel alone.
With you, I feel home.

I don’t know what the future will look like,
but I know I want you to be part of it.

Happy Valentine’s Day.

— Rexy ❤️
# 🌸 Our Story

I still remember when we started talking.

I didn’t expect you to become someone this important to me.

You came into my life calmly,  
but slowly you became someone I can’t imagine losing.

Every moment with you feels warm, safe, and real.

And I’m really grateful for you.
# 💌 Reasons I Love You

• You are patient with me  
• You make me laugh  
• You support me  
• You accept me as I am  
• You make me want to be better  
• You make me feel home  

And honestly…  
There are so many reasons I can’t even list them all.

#💍**Our First Couple Ring**
This ring is not just an object for me.
It reminds me of us, of promises, of feelings that are real and honest.
